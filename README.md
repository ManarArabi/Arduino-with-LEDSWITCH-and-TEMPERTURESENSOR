# Arduino-with-LEDSWITCH-and-TEMPERTURESENSOR
Controlling LED with push-button and reading temperture

Components : 

1) Arduino UNO
2) LED
3) Push-button
4) Resistors
5) LM35 (temperture sensor)

Circuit :

How this program work : 


When the button is pushed the LED state is toggled once and the program send the LED state to the serial monitor and this is the first part .

Each 3 seconds the sensor reads current temperture and convert it to Celsius .

Assumptions :


Push-button is connected to pin 2 , LED is connected to pin 12 and temperture sensor is connected to pin A0 .

What I've learned : 

Floating state with arduino , when the common between circuit component isn't the same and this is leading to terrible errors .

Finally I used an online simulator for circuit and code .


In this way I tested the code .
