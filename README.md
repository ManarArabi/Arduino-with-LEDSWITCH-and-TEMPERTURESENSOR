# Arduino-with-LEDSWITCH-and-TEMPERTURESENSOR
Controlling LED with push-button and reading temperture .

Components : 

1) Arduino UNO .
2) LED .
3) Push-button .
4) Resistors .
5) LM35 (temperture sensor) .

Circuit :

How this program work : 


When the button is pushed the LED state is toggled once and the program send the LED state to the serial monitor and this is the first part .

Each 3 seconds the sensor reads current temperture and convert it to Celsius .

Assumptions :


Push-button is connected to pin 2 , LED is connected to pin 12 and temperture sensor is connected to pin A0 .



Finally I used an online simulator for circuit and code .


In this way I tested the code .
